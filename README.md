# summer24 - Financial Planner
Summer 2024 Project

## description
in this project, I aim to create a financial planning website that helps users budget and prepare for retirement. My target audience are individuals that want to take the first
step towards financial literacy. The key features of the platform will include a budget planning function, an expense and income tracker, and educational resources. 

## tech stack
I will use HTML/CSS for the frontend, Python for the backend, and Jira for the scrum management of the project.
